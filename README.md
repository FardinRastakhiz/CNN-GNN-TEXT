## GCNet: a Combination of Graph and Convolutional Neural Network for Texts

## Introduction

This project is part of [GCNet](). This project explores the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), for tasks on texts such as text classification and text embedding. Here is some of use-cases where explored or want to explore:

- Text classification
- Spam detection
- Search engine optimization (SEO)
- Vector embedding for RAG and Vector database
- Knowledge distillation
- Named entity recognition (NER)
