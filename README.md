## Introduction

## Project Structure
You can run the notebooks in the folder 'codes/notebooks/'
 - 0_Preparation: Is to prepare token information such as embeddings, frequencies, and sentiment data.
 - 1_FindBestModel: Is for ablation study and find the best settings and features for the model
 - 2_CompareWithClassificationModels: Is to compare the model with other classifcation models
   
The last part will be improved in the next update. Project is not in the final stage, I'll clean it up after publishing.
